Before coming to IU last fall, I worked at Michigan State University as a lab technician for a lab that studies the mutualism between grape plants and mites, where grape leaves produce tufts of hairs on the leaves called "domatia" that house mites in return for them eating herbivorous mites and pathogenic fungi that harm the plant. Those mites are colloquially called bodyguard mites!
